                  Often times, we are led to believe that the best way to deal
                  with pain is to forget about it. Tostop thinking about it and
                  leave it in the past. We are told to remember that it could
                  have been worse and that everyone goes through one thing or
                  the other. But you know the problem with this mindset? It is a
                  bandaid on a wound that needs to be treated.
                </p>
                <p>
                  When you ignore a pain without dealing with it in an
                  intentional and positive manner, you are only delaying an
                  eruption. This pain will show up in other areas of your life
                  when you least expect it. And when pain shows up in other
                  places, it affects other areas of your life. What if I told
                  you that you can make a simple decision right now that will
                  help you begin on the path to healing your pain?
                </p>
                <p>
                  What if I showed you that pain is a gift that you can use to
                  build a beautiful life for yourself? Would you believe me?
                  Would you be willing to ignore your fears and give yourself a
                  chance to live a better life? If your answer is yes, then I
                  invite you to join me on the Intentional Healing Challenge.
