                Thanks to Amba who encouraged me to take the client and also
                increase my price. I was really scared that she would turn down
                the price and because it's my first time doing something like
                that for someone else. She reached out to me to help her create
                her online course (didn't know her, neither is she following
                me). After charging her initially she said the price was high
                and we later negotiated, and that's how I landed my first 6
                figure client. Thank you so much Amba, and I'm really happy to
                be part of the tribe.

                  The push to do it, the insights on tools to use, and how best
                  to craft your offer. The sessions every week allows you
                  clarify your offer better. One is able to ask questions,
                  brainstorm, make mistakes, and correct them here even before
                  we take it public. It's definitely a must for anyone seeking
                  to break even, and if you have no clues at all on what to do,
                  you will gain clarity here. Thank you so much.
